Project Description: 
The Sentiment Analysis Tool is a powerful application designed to automate the process of scraping, analyzing, and storing information from online articles. By integrating web scraping, named entity recognition, and sentiment analysis, this tool enables users to efficiently extract valuable insights from the vast amount of content available on the internet.

Implementation: 
The tool was implemented using Python, leveraging libraries such as BeautifulSoup and Requests for web scraping, which allow the application to fetch and parse HTML content from various websites. Named entity recognition and sentiment analysis are powered by natural language processing techniques, enabling the identification of key entities (like people and organizations) and the evaluation of the overall sentiment of the articles. The data is stored in a SQLite database, ensuring efficient management and retrieval of analyzed information.

Final Output: 
The final output of the Sentiment Analysis Tool includes a structured analysis of the input article, which consists of the article's title, content, identified entities, and sentiment evaluation. Users can input a URL, and the tool will return a comprehensive summary that highlights key insights, making it easier to understand the article's context and emotional tone. This output is designed to assist researchers, marketers, and content creators in making informed decisions based on the analyzed data.
